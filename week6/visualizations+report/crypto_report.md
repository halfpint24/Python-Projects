# Weekly Cryptocurrency Analysis Report

This week’s analysis compared Bitcoin and Ethereum using cleaned daily price data, focusing on price trends, volatility, and correlations. Both cryptocurrencies generally moved in the same direction, but Ethereum showed larger swings and a wider distribution of daily returns, making it more volatile than Bitcoin. The line chart of prices highlighted similar trajectories, while the histogram of daily returns emphasized Ethereum’s higher risk profile. Looking ahead, simple forecasting methods such as moving averages or linear trend extrapolation could be applied to project short-term price movements, while more advanced approaches like machine learning models could capture complex patterns and improve predictions. Expanding the analysis to include rolling volatility, monthly returns, and scenario-based forecasts would provide more actionable insights for decision-making, particularly for stakeholders evaluating risk versus reward in cryptocurrency markets.
