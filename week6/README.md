# üìà Crypto Historical Price Fetcher

This project provides a simple Python script to fetch **historical cryptocurrency price data** (Bitcoin, Ethereum by default) using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and save it as CSV files for further analysis.

## üöÄ Features
- Fetches daily historical price data for one or more cryptocurrencies.  
- Uses the **CoinGecko API** (free & reliable).  
- Saves results into CSV files named after each cryptocurrency (e.g., `bitcoin.csv`, `ethereum.csv`).  
- Easy to customize: simply add or remove coins from the list.  

## üìÇ Project Structure
```
crypto.py          # Main script
bitcoin.csv        # Example output file (Bitcoin price history)
ethereum.csv       # Example output file (Ethereum price history)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Make sure you have Python **3.7+** installed.  
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pycoingecko pandas
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Run the script directly:

```bash
python crypto.py
```

By default, it will:
- Fetch **1 year** of historical price data (from today going back 365 days).  
- Save the data into CSV files (`bitcoin.csv`, `ethereum.csv`).  

## üîß Customization
You can easily modify:
- **Cryptocurrencies** to fetch by editing the list:
  ```python
  cryptocurrencies = ['bitcoin', 'ethereum']
  ```
- **Currency** to compare against (default: `usd`):
  ```python
  vscurrency = 'usd'
  ```
- **Date range** (default: last 365 days):
  ```python
  start_date = "2023-09-01"
  end_date   = "2024-09-01"
  ```

## üìä Example Output
The generated CSV files contain:
```
date,price
2024-09-01,58500.12
2024-09-02,59021.45
...
```

## üîç Data Cleaning & Analysis (`crypto_analysis.py`)

This repo also includes a small analysis script that **cleans the CSVs and prints basic metrics** for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### What it does
- Loads `bitcoin.csv` and `ethereum.csv` generated by the fetcher
- Drops rows with missing values
- Parses and sorts by `date`
- Saves cleaned datasets as `bitcoin_cleaned.csv` and `ethereum_cleaned.csv`
- Prints summary statistics for each asset:
  - Average, minimum, maximum price
  - Volatility (standard deviation of price)
- Computes **daily returns** and prints the **correlation** between BTC and ETH returns

### Requirements (in addition to the fetcher)
```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Usage
After you've fetched the raw CSVs with the fetcher, run:
```bash
python crypto_analysis.py
```
This will print metrics to the console and write cleaned CSVs next to the originals.

### Example console output
```
Average price: $xxxxx.xx
Minimum price: $xxxxx.xx
Maximum price: $xxxxx.xx
Volatility (std): $xxxxx.xx

Returns:
<first few rows of percentage changes>

Correlation:
<2x2 correlation matrix>
```

### Outputs
- `bitcoin_cleaned.csv`
- `ethereum_cleaned.csv`
